# Git Practice

The article that I found for this exercise is: [How to tell what level of developer you are, junior to senior](https://jg.gg/2020/11/22/how-to-tell-what-level-of-developer-you-are/?source=post_page-----56b0d9de2c43---------------------------------------).

What I found interesting about this article is that it argues that Software Engineering is relatively meritocratic compared to other fields and that this profession is uniquely rewarding. It emphasizes the continuous growth that Software Engineers experience every day and a rapid career growth based on one’s skill level rather than age or connections. 

Also an interesting problem that this text argues is that due to the rapid progression, a team member might be left unsure of their standing within the work environment. The article proposes a solution where you can determine your standing: 
- Junior Developer: Overcoming the "relentless confusion" of tools and concepts. Daily work involves mysteries and their solutions.

- Mid-Level Developer: Focus shifts from how to code to what code to write and what problems to solve.

- Senior Developer: Defined not by raw coding skill, but by technical intuition and superior judgment. Focuses on delivering real value and being a team pillar.
